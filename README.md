# Bulk Messaging System - React Frontend

This is the front-end of the Bulk Messaging System, built with ReactJS. The system allows users to send bulk messages at different prices, manage contacts, and subscriptions.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for easy navigation and operation
- Bulk messaging capabilities with different pricing tiers
- Contact management system for easy management of customer data
- Subscription management system for managing customer subscriptions and payment plans

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16.x or later
- NPM v8.x or later

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the `root` directory
3. Run `yarn` to install dependencies

### Usage

To start the development server, run `npm start` from the `root` directory. The server should start running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

Once the server is running, you can navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your web browser to access the system.

## Deployment

To deploy the system in a production environment, you will need to build the React app using `npm run build`. This will create a `build` directory containing the production-ready assets.

You can then serve the assets using your preferred web server, such as Nginx or Apache.
